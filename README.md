The file_differences.py will produce two textfiles contain the differences found when two text file compared against the other. The python program can be run from the command line and must be given two textfile arguments. The program will output two text files "txt_diff1.txt" and "txt_diff2.txt". 


The sample text files provided, 'sample1.txt' and 'sample2.txt', have a list of emails and we'll run through a quick demo using these files.

First, in the command prompt navigate to where the python file is located. Then run the following command:
> python file_differences.py txt_diff1.txt txt_diff2.txt
